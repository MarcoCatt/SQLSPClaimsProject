Project Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many claims require regular publishes on the Reserving Tool, so we need to develop a
procedure that will:
1. Identify which claims require regular publishes on the Reserving Tool
2. Calculate how many days left the current examiner has to complete a publish, or if the
publish is late, how many days a publish is overdue
3. Display key information related to these claims including the calculated fields in step 2
4. Accept parameters allowing users to see results for specific situations
The final query should filter out the claims that donâ€™t require a publish, and should display the
required fields that will give us the information requested for this project

Each of the above steps is commented in the code
